# Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

The goal of this project is to get map data from a region of the world; audit the data; fix the problems found; import the data into a MongoDB database and run some exploratory queries against it. The place in the world that I chose is Göttingen because it is near my current location. Göttingen is most famous for its university from which “45 Nobel Prize Laurates were linked via their Curriculum Vitae” ([Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, 2015](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/nobel-prize-laureates-from-g%C3%B6ttingen/4281.html)).
